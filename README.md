# Microprocessor-without-Interlocked-Pipeline-Stages-16-bit-in-VHDL

MIPS (an acronym for Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA).
The MIPS processor implemented is a 16-bit version that includes schema, principles of operation, execution of each instruction implemented on the processor.
